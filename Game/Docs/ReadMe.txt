How to use:

Controller
	- Left Joystick to rotate and move
	- Back to exit
	- Start to play/ skip/ respawn
	- A to shoot
Keyboard
	- E to thrust forward
	- S to turn left
	- F to turn right
	- Space to shoot/ start/ skip/ respawn
	- N to respawn
	- ESC to exit

Game Features:
	- Additional Enemies: Covid and Boss.
	- Vertex Anim: Beetle, Wasp, and Covid .
	- Hit indications: Entity will flash white when it got hit.
	- Boss level: level 5 will be boss level.
		- Boss has 3 phases
			- 100% - 67% HP: Big and fast, shoots 1 bullet and spawn asteroid.
			- 66% - 34% HP: Medium size and speed, shoot 6 bullets in 6 directions.
			- 33% - 0% HP: Spawn a random entity rapidly.
	- Spawn invulnerability
	- Overheating Autofire
	- Cutscene: Before and After the game.

Known issues:

	- There is an rare bug where the player's ship can get stuck accelerating parallel to the edge of the screen. The ship ends up in an unresponsive stuck state along the screen edge.	The only workaround right now is for the player to rotate their ship to face back inside the playable area, then apply thrust again to push away from the edge. 

Deep Learning:

I've learned valuable coding lessons and practices during my time at Guildhall. Adopting top-down design and an iterative approach has improved my skills. With top-down coding, I plan high-level components first rather than cramming everything into one function. This makes code more maintainable and extensible. Using an iterative process of designing, drafting, testing, and refining has helped me better understand program architecture and make incremental progress.My mindset about quality code has matured. Instead of focusing on just functionality, I now strive to write well-structured, readable code from the start, refactoring as needed. If I don't have a complete solution yet, I'll prototype key parts to start the iterative refinement loop. This incremental coding style has been a major learning experience.

I am most productive when operating with a clear plan and goals. In the beginning of the project, I would sometimes jump into coding without proper planning. However, I've realized this scattered approach is less efficient than strategizing ahead. When I have defined tasks and objectives, I can focus intently on execution without unnecessary breaks. Without plans, I end up taking more intermittent breaks to figure out next steps, which disrupts momentum. Through observation and trial-and-error, I've determined my optimal work strategy is to plan out my tasks in detail for the week ahead. I set deadlines for each item to stay on track. If I get stuck on a task for too long, I will proactively seek help instead of spinning my wheels.

I haven't found any tasks particularly stressful in this project. I believe any issues simply indicate an area I need to better comprehend. When facing bugs or errors, I take a step back to review the core concept and explain it to myself. For example, pointers and memory allocation are challenging coming from a non-C++ background. I debugged null pointer bugs by re-reading pointer documentation and explaining out loud how they work. I considered my specific pointer usage and expectations to uncover my misunderstanding. There's a thrill when you finally grasp something that's been confounding you. Implementing cool new features in Starship Gold is also thrilling since I get to explore creative ideas. This excitement motivates me to continually push my technical skills. Rather than getting stressed, I leverage bugs and challenges as opportunities for deeper learning. Slowing down to methodically break things down and verbalize my knowledge gives me greater mastery. I enjoy the rewarding feeling of reaching greater clarity on complex topics.
